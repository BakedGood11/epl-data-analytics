    Season](#comparing-arsenals-home-vs.-away-performance-throughout-the-season)

#### Overview

A(r)senal Analysis is an analytical exploration of Arsenal’s performance
in the 2024-2025 season of the English Premier League. The team was
chosen because of their ability to outperform league leaders and top
contenders in the UEFA Champion’s League (particularly their 3-0 win
over Real Madrid), but showing signs of weakness in front of the goal.

Fans claimed the season to be Arsenal’s year, especially since
Manchester City’s dominance looked to be on a down-trend. Unfortunately,
the season would end with Liverpool on top and Arsenal, yet again, found
in second place.

## Comparing Arsenal’s Home vs. Away Performance Throughout The Season

Arsenal’s 2024-2025 title run ended in a heartbreaking result at second
place in the Premier League table. A downward trend in *Home* goals over
the season is visible while *Away* games show an almost flat trend line.
Both can be attributed to drastic changes in performance given how high
scoring games are countered by multiple low scores, including
consecutive zero (0) goals in to *Away* match ups.
